# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Flipkart-Reviews
In this project, I analyzed customer reviews from Flipkart to understand their feelings about products.
I used a dataset of reviews along with their ratings.
Reviews rated 4 or 5 stars were labeled as positive, 3 stars as neutral, and 1 or 2 stars as negative.
I cleaned the text data by removing links, special characters, and making everything lowercase.
Then, I transformed the text into numbers using a method called TF-IDF.
I trained three machine learning models: Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
I tested these models to see how well they could predict sentiments.
To improve accuracy, I combined the predictions from all three models using majority voting.
The results showed how many reviews were positive, negative, or neutral.
This analysis helps businesses understand customer satisfaction and improve their products.
